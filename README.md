# Audiomint: Music NFT Marketplace Dapp

Audiomint is a decentralized music NFT marketplace where anyone can mint and own unique NFT songs, tied to their blockchain-based owner ID. Built using Solidity and React, the platform enables secure creation and trade of music assets through MetaMask, supporting multiple cryptocurrencies. Audiomint also features dynamic pricing influenced by song popularity, ownership history, and artist activity. By removing gatekeeping and empowering users to directly mint and monetize their work, Audiomint creates a transparent, inclusive, and creator-driven ecosystem for digital music ownership. Audiomint empowers artists and fans by creating a transparent, user-driven ecosystem for digital music ownership.

Check out our Dapp! Disclaimer you will need to have a MetaMask account or MetaMask extension to see full implementation of our website. If you don't have a MetaMask account and the MetaMask browser extension, the Dapp will not be able to connect to your MetaMask wallet and you won't be able to see full functionality of the Dapp.

Project Update: If don't have a MetaMask account and would still like to see the full visual layout and interface of our website, you can go to the D-app UI and Interface folder where I have added images of how all the tabs and sections on our website would look and appear if you had a MetaMask account or wallet connected to the site.

You can mint, list, buy, and sell ownership rights to music NFTs, and audio file NFTs on our Dapp. Audiomint is a decentralized application that empowers artists to express and represent their music exactly how they would like to with complete freedom and with no reason to be bounded by constraints of a music or record label. So check it out and Enjoy!! (but also use responsibly)
